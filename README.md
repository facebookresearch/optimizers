cd optimizers
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

After installation, basic usage looks like:
```
import torch
from distributed_shampoo.distributed_shampoo import DistributedShampoo
from distributed_shampoo.shampoo_types import AdamGraftingConfig

model = ...  # Instantiate model

optim = DistributedShampoo(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-3,
    betas=(0.9, 0.999),
    epsilon=1e-8,
    grafting_config=AdamGraftingConfig(
        beta2=0.999,
        epsilon=1e-8,
    ),
)
```
