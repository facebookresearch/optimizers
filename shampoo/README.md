# Distributed Shampoo

An experimental Shampoo implementation in PyTorch as described in [1, 2]. Under development. Currently only supports dense parameters.

Key distinctives of this implementation include:
- Incorporation of learning rate grafting [3]. Our version of grafting only grafts the second moment/diagonal preconditioner. Momentum/first moment updates are performed separate from grafting. Supports the methods:
    - SGD
    - Adagrad
    - RMSProp
    - Adam
- Supports both normal and AdamW weight decay.
- Incorporates exponential moving averaging (with or without bias correction) to the estimate the first moment (akin to Adam). (To be further investigated.)
- Distribution of the root inverse computation across different GPUs for the data-parallel setting. Supports data-parallel multi-node, multi-GPU training using `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`. Broadcasts are performed using `torch.dist`. Does not perform CPU offloading as done in [2].
- Offers different options to handle large-dimensional tensors, including:
    - Diagonalizing the Shampoo preconditioners.
    - Using standard diagonal Adagrad.
    - Blocking the tensor and applying Shampoo to each block. (Needs to be improved.)
- Offers multiple approaches for computing the root inverse, including:
    - Using symmetric eigendecomposition (used by default).
    - Coupled inverse Newton iteration [4].
- Choice of precision for preconditioner accumulation and root inverse computation.
- Merging of small dimensions.

## How to Use
Given a learning rate schedule for another method, one should simply replace the optimizer with Shampoo and graft from the previous method.

For example, if we originally had
```
optimizer = optim.AdamW(nn.parameters(), lr=0.001, betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-08, weight_decay=0.01)
```
we would instead use
```
optimizer = shampoo.Shampoo(
    nn.parameters(),
    lr=0.001,
    betas=(0.9, 0.999),
    epsilon=1e-12,
    use_bias_correction=True,
    adam_w_mode=True,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    grafting_type=GraftingType.ADAM,
    grafting_epsilon=1e-08,
    grafting_beta2=0.999,
)
```
