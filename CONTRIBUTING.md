# Contributing to Optimizers
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible. Our goal is to provide a repo that promotes optimizer research
and development separate from the official PyTorch library. Please only
create pull requests for improving existing optimizers in the repo; new
optimizers should be created in a separate public repo.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests for existing optimizers.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`. Install the package inside of your Python environment with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes. To run the subset of the tests that can be run on CPU use `make test`; to run the subset of tests that require four GPUs use `make test-gpu`.
5. Make sure your code lints. You can use `make lint` and `make format` to automatically lint and format the code where possible.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
