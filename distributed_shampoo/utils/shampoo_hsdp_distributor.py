class HSDPDistributor(DistributorInterface):
    """HSDP Distributor class.

    Handles split tensor block recovery of different parameters, then merging and blocking of
    the tensor blocks, as well as distributing of the parameters at instantiation.

    The constructor internally sets up `DeviceMesh` objects as necessary for distributing memory
    and computation, so torch.distributed must be initialized in advance.

    Unlike FSDPDistributor, HSDPDistributor requires the user to pass in a device mesh used for
    HSDP. For example, suppose we have 48 GPUs and the HSDP group size is 8. Then:

    HSDP Device Mesh with (Replicate, Shard) = (6, 8):

        device_mesh = [[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7]
                       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
                       [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]
                       [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
                       [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]
                       [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]]

    For example, if my device is rank 11, then:
        device_mesh["replicate"] = [3, 11, 19, 27, 35, 43]
        device_mesh["shard"] = [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

    Since the parameters are sharded along the "shard" dimension, we would normally replicate the
    computation along the "replicate" dimension. With HSDP Shampoo, we instead want to distribute
    the computation and memory requirements across the "replicate" dimension of the original HSDP
    device mesh.

    For example, suppose that the num_trainers_per_group = 3. We want to form a (2, 3)-submesh on
    the ranks [3, 11, 19, 27, 35, 43] (and similar).

    HSDPDistributor 2D Sub-Mesh Example with (Replicate, Shard) = (2, 3):

        submesh = [[ 3, 11, 19]
                   [27, 35, 43]]

    In this case, optimizer states will live on different "replicate" meshes: {[3, 27], [11, 35],
    [19, 43]}. In order to synchronize the optimizer step, we will communicate along the "shard"
    mesh {[3, 11, 19], [27, 35, 43]}.
